{"name":"Siraj","tagline":"Cross-platform, RegEx-based, GUI Textual Log Parser","body":"*Siraj* is a cross-platform textual log parser that was built using Python3 and Qt  \r\n![](https://github.com/embedded-slam/siraj/blob/master/siraj_screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nTextual logs can sometimes be huge. And going through them with standard text \r\neditor without color coding or filtering can be really frustrating job.\r\n\r\n# Solution [as offered by *Siraj*]\r\n*Siraj*  aims to facilitate textual logs analysis by presenting the textual\r\nlog in a user-friendly tabular format, it also allows the user to show/hide rows \r\nbased on their contents. As well as linking each log trace with the source line\r\nthat generated it to give context while analyzing the log.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n# Quick feature list\r\n1.  Parsing any textual log and present matched fields as a **tabular format**.\r\n2.  Matching logs is based on **Regular Expressions** for maximum flexibility.\r\n3.  **Conditionally formatting** the table cells foreground/background colors based on the contents.\r\n4.\t**Hiding** one or more rows based on the contents.\r\n5.\t**Showing** only specific rows and hiding everything else.\r\n6.  **Cross-referencing the source code** file/line that generated the log if applicable.\r\n7.\tCalculating the **time difference** between any two rows in the table if applicable.\r\n8.  **Cross-platform**, Works on Linux, Windows, and Mac (not tested on Mac yet but it should work).\r\n9.  **Light-weight**, It relies on the Qt (written in C++) to do the heavy-lifting.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n# Running Siraj\r\n## From the source (Preferred method)\r\n\r\nBefore you use *Siraj* you'll need to install and configure the following based\r\non your target system:\r\n\r\n1.  [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). \r\n2.  [SIP](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download).\r\n3.  [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).\r\n\r\nOnce you have the prerequisites you can run the tool using it's main module as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n`python siraj.py` \r\n\r\n## From the binaries\r\nIf you only need to use the tool and don't have/need python or Qt, you can \r\ndownload one of the following archives based on your system. \r\n                 \r\n1.\t[Linux.]  \t(https://github.com/embedded-slam/siraj/raw/release/release/linux/siraj_linux.tar.gz)\r\n2. \t[Windows.]\t(https://github.com/embedded-slam/siraj/raw/release/release/windows/siraj_windows.zip) \r\n3.\tMac.  _Comming soon!_  \r\n\r\nOnce downloaded, you'll need to extract it and run *sirag*. This will run with \r\nthe provided sample log `sample.log` and the provided sample configuration \r\n`siraj_configs.json`. You can then fine tune the configuration and load the \r\nlog of your choice.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nLinux and Windows binaries were created using [cx_freeze](http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/ \"cx_freeze\") \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n# Using Siraj\r\n## Configuration\r\nSiraj relies on a configuration file called siraj_configs.json which looks as shown below, You'll need to modify this file to suite your needs.\r\n\r\nSince JSON doesn't allow inline comments, the different configuration items are described below:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"log_file_full_path\": \"sample.log\", \r\n\t\t\"file_line_column_number_zero_based\": 4,\r\n\t\t\"log_row_pattern\" : \"^(?P<LEVEL>[^|]+)\\\\|(?P<FUNCTION>[^|]+)\\\\|(?P<MESSAGE>[^|]+)\\\\|(?P<TIME>[^|]+)\\\\|(?P<FILE_AND_LINE>[^|]+)$\",\r\n\t\t\"root_source_path_prefix\" : \"\",\r\n\t\t\"time_stamp_column_number_zero_based\": 3,\r\n\t\t\"table_conditional_formatting_config\" : \r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"foreground_key_column\" : 0,\r\n\t\t\t\"foreground_color_dict\" : \r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"DEBUG\" \t: \"green\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"INFO\" \t\t: \"blue\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"WARNING\" \t: \"white\"\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\"background_key_column\" : 0,\r\n\t\t\t\"background_color_dict\" : \r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t    \"WARNING\" \t: \"red\"\r\n\t\t\t},\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\"special_formatting_key_column\" : 1,\r\n\t\t\t\"special_formatting_color_dict\":\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"cell_left_clicked\" : \r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"foreground\" : \"white\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"background\" : \"purple\"\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t\"hide_filtered_out_entries\" : \r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"foreground\" : \"white\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"background\" : \"blue\"\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t\"get_config_item\" : \r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"foreground\" : \"white\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"background\" : \"darkCyan\"\r\n\t\t\t\t}\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n`log_file_full_path`  \r\nThe log file to load initially on startup. Other log files can be opened from the GUI through File > Open menu. Currently the configuration file name is hard-coded. Later it can be loaded from the GUI.\r\n\r\n`file_line_column_number_zero_based`  \r\nThe column number that contains the file and line information, assumption here that\r\nfile and line will be separated by a colon (file:line). This also can be changed in the future to make it more flexible.\r\n\r\nThis is the column based on the log___row___pattern regex criteria. First column is index 0.\r\n\r\n`log_row_pattern`  \r\nThis is the most important configuration. This tells Siraj how to identify fields in the log lines. Matched log line is placed in the table. This uses RegEx named group to achieve two goals:\r\n\r\n1.\tExtract the different fields from each log line.\r\n2.\tName the columns after the group names (compare the configuration to the screenshot).\r\n\r\n`root_source_path_prefix`  \r\nFor logs that contains file:line information. This field contains the path prefix that if appended to the file mentioned in the log it produce the full file path. This is used to load the corresponding file if the file:line field was clicked.\r\n\r\n`time_stamp_column_number_zero_based`  \r\nDetermines the column index that contains the timing information (if any). This is mainly used to calculate the elapsed time between any two selected logs.\r\n\r\n`table_conditional_formatting_config`  \r\nContains the conditional formatting dictionary for foreground and background colors\r\n\r\n`foreground_key_column and background_key_column`  \r\nDetermines which columns will be used to determine the foreground and background colors of each rows based on the row contents intersecting with that column.\r\n\r\n`foreground_color_dict and background_color_dict`     \r\nDictionaries that hold pairs for key/values. Where the key is a match to perform against each row at cell of intersection with the respective column (foreground/background key), and the value is the color to use for Foreground/background.\r\n\r\nCells that doesn't match any value in this dictionary will be displayed using the default colors. Black foreground on white background.\r\n\r\n`special_formatting_key_column`  \r\nThis column can have formatting rules that overrides the default rule applied on the row. When a cell in that column match the search criteria it can have a different Foreground/Background than the rest of cells on the same row.\r\n\r\n`special_formatting_color_dict`  \r\nA dictionary for the special formatting of cells falling under the `special_formatting_key_column`. The key is the text to match, and the value is a dictionary for the foreground and background colors to use with matching cells.\r\n\r\nExample for this can be seen in the _FUNCTION_  column in the screenshot above.\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\n\r\n\r\n`H`  \r\nHides all the rows with fields that matches the selected cells(s).  \r\n\r\n`O`  \r\nShows Only selected. Hides everything except rows with fields that matches the selected cell(s).  \r\n\r\n`Del`  \r\nClears all current filter.  \r\n\r\nThe three options are also accessible via context menu. To unhide a previously hidden row, you can select the unhide option from the context menu for a list of hidden value of the current column, then select the value to unhide.  \r\n\r\nWhen multiple cells are selected which belong to one or more column(s) and the hide option is triggered, then a row will be hidden if any of its fields(columns) matches any filtered-out value in the corresponding column.\r\n\r\nWhen multiple cells are selected which belong to one or more column(s) and the show-only option is triggered, then a row will be shown only if all of its fields(columns) matches the corresponding filtered-in column.\r\n\r\n`P`  \r\nJumps to the previous matching cell (if one exists) from the same column. Works only when a single cell is selected.  \r\n\r\n`N`  \r\nJumps to the next matching cell (if one exists) from the same column. Works only when a single cell is selected.  \r\n\r\n`Selecting two cells from different columns`  \r\nwill show the elapsed time between the two logs. This is only applicable if the log fields contains a time field and it is specified in the configuration via `time_stamp_column_number_zero_based`.  \r\n\r\n`Selecting a cell from the file/line column`  \r\nThis will display the code that generated the current log in the `TextView` at the bottom.  \r\n\r\n`Double-clicking a cell from the file/line column`  \r\nThis will open the file that generated the current log and highlight the current line in an external text editor for more appealing code view (eg. syntax highlighting). Currently this text editor is hard-coded to gedit which only works on Linux AFAIK. [Issue #15](https://github.com/embedded-slam/siraj/issues/15 \"Issue #15\") is there to fix that.  \r\n","google":"UA-12176850-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
